# ACE
ACE (short for Audio Cue Editor) is a tool for editing CriWare ACB files, primarily for Xenoverse 2 but it can also load ACBs from other games (though older ACB formats generally aren't supported). 

You can add, delete, copy and paste cues and tracks with no 
arbitrary limits. Additional features include volume control and 
randomization, track randomization (multiple tracks on one cue, plays 
one randomly), cue limits, loop editing, and action tracks (starting and stopping cues from separate cues). The tool also makes use of an 
undo/redo system, with every edit being undoable.
