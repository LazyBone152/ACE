# ACE
ACE (short for Audio Cue Editor) is a tool for editing and previewing CRIWARE ACB/AWB files. It was originally developed for DB Xenoverse 2 ACBs but support for both older and newer ACBs used in some other games has since been added.

You can add, delete, copy and paste cues and tracks with no arbitrary limits. Additional features include volume control and randomization, track randomization (multiple tracks on one cue, plays one randomly), cue limits, loop editing, and action tracks (starting and stopping cues from separate cues). The tool also makes use of an undo/redo system, with every edit being undoable.
